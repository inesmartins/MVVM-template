This is a boilerplate for an iOS app built using the MVVM architecture, Reactive Programming and the Coordinator pattern.
The Coordinator pattern is built using RxFlow.

### How to Use

This project uses CocoaPods instead of Carthage because of incompatibility between RxSwift and Carthage.

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod install
```
